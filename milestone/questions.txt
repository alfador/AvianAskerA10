Documentation says attributes go from 1 to 283, but they go from 0 to 287.

As the code is currently set up, it's impossible to ask about attribute 0
(since that case corresponds to guessing the last bird).

The current code doesn't return "I don't know" when the attribute is not
listed in 'dataset.txt'
